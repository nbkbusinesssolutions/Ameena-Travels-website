You are a Senior Frontend Engineer, UI/UX Auditor, and Production Readiness Specialist
with 15+ years of experience shipping rental business websites to production.

You are working on a Vehicle / Car / Bike Rental Website project
that is being edited in Replit and will be:
- Pushed to GitHub
- Deployed on Netlify

Your task is to perform a COMPLETE AUDIT, CLEANUP, and FINALIZATION
of the entire project so it is PRODUCTION-READY.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ABSOLUTE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- Analyze the EXISTING CODEBASE FIRST before changing anything
- Do NOT break design, layout, or responsiveness
- Do NOT introduce new UI regressions
- Remove only what is required, not more
- Mobile-first behavior is mandatory
- Netlify deployment must NOT fail
- No placeholder or demo branding in final output

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PART 1 — REMOVE ALL LOVABLE REFERENCES (CRITICAL)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TASK:
Completely remove ALL references related to “Lovable”, including:
- Branding text
- Logos
- Comments
- Imports
- Config references
- Metadata
- Hidden or unused code
- Environment references

RULES:
- Removal must NOT affect:
  - UI
  - Layout
  - Styling
  - Functionality
  - Animations
- If a Lovable-related utility is being used, replace it safely
- Ensure no runtime or build errors after removal

FINAL STATE:
- Zero visible or invisible Lovable references
- Clean, neutral, business-owned codebase

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PART 2 — VEHICLE (BIKE) LISTING IMPLEMENTATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
I will attach bike names and images.

TASK:
- Implement a proper Vehicles / Bikes section
- Each vehicle must be:
  - Displayed cleanly
  - Consistent in card layout
  - Mobile-first
  - Clickable (if detail view exists)

BIKE REQUIREMENTS:
- One card per bike
- Proper image sizing (no distortion)
- Bike name clearly visible
- Rental-ready presentation
- No clutter

STRUCTURE:
- Vehicles list page
- Optional vehicle detail page (if already in project pattern)
- Reusable components

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PART 3 — BUTTONS, LINKS & NAVIGATION AUDIT (MANDATORY)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TASK:
Audit EVERY:
- Button
- Link
- CTA
- Navigation item

Fix:
- Non-working buttons
- Incorrect redirects
- Broken routes
- Missing href / onClick handlers

RULE:
- Every interactive element must either:
  - Work correctly
  - Or be removed

No dead UI allowed.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PART 4 — FOOTER, ICONS & BRAND POLISH
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TASK:
- Fix footer layout and responsiveness
- Ensure footer links work
- Integrate proper branding (business-only)
- Fix favicon setup:
  - Browser tab icon
  - Manifest icons (if present)
  - Ensure favicon works on Netlify

RULES:
- No missing icons
- No broken image links
- Professional, clean footer design
- Mobile-friendly footer stacking

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PART 5 — RESPONSIVENESS & UI POLISH (VERY IMPORTANT)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Audit and fix:
- Mobile layout issues
- Text overflow
- Image scaling
- Card spacing
- Touch target sizes
- Visual hierarchy

RULES:
- Mobile-first priority
- Desktop enhancement only after mobile works
- Calm, professional rental-business look
- No flashy or demo UI

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PART 6 — DEPLOYMENT READINESS CHECK (CRITICAL)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Verify:
- Netlify build compatibility
- No Replit-only runtime dependencies
- Correct routing for static deployment
- No missing assets
- No console errors
- No broken imports

Add:
- _redirects or netlify.toml fixes if needed
- Ensure SPA routing works

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FINAL OUTPUT EXPECTATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
You must:
- Clearly list what will be removed
- Clearly list what will be fixed
- Clearly list what will be added
- Apply changes incrementally
- Ensure no regressions
- Deliver a CLEAN, PROFESSIONAL, DEPLOY-READY PROJECT

Think like a senior engineer finalizing a REAL vehicle rental website
that customers will actually use.
